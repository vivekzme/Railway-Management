The objective of the Railway Management project is to optimize the scheduling of train movements to reduce delays and improve efficiency in the transportation system. By carefully analyzing and optimizing train routes, timetables, and resource allocation, the goal is to minimize the cumulative delay across all trains.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these installation steps:

1. **IBM CPLEX**: Refer to IBM CPLEX and login using your academic email address to gain access to all features.

2. **Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies, such as JAVA, as needed for the project.

## Procedure and Result

In this project, optimization techniques with CPLEX Optimizer were utilized to create the optimal schedule for 200 trains traveling through 17 railway zones in India. To simulate the train movements, random data for their entry and exit times within each zone was generated and stored in a .dat file. The primary objective was to minimize the total delay experienced by all trains. Through the use of CPLEX, the most efficient schedule was determined, resulting in reduced delays for the given data.

## Repository Guide

- **project.mod**: This file contains the code for the project, defining the optimization model using the Constraint Programming Framework.

- **project.dat**: Contains the test data required for the model.

- **project.pdf**: This file contains a concise description used for presentation purposes. It provides an overview of the project's key aspects, including the problem statement, methodology, and results.

## Future Work

Future work on this project may include:
- Incorporating real-world data to validate and improve the model's accuracy.
- Expanding the application of the optimization techniques to other scenarios, such as reducing passenger congestion at airports.
- Utilizing more data points and exploring edge cases to further validate the code's robustness and effectiveness.
